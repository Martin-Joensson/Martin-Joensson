# Hi there ğŸ‘‹ I'm Martin!
I'm a developer from Sweden. Really like making practical things for the web.
I have a background as a teacher and linguist. Both of which still peak my interest regularly!

## All the gitHub things:
- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on various digital tools for Roleplaying Games
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning TypeScript
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on what you think is cool!
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about game mechanics and languages. 
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: send a message!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I play several musical instruments and read boardgame rules for fun.
